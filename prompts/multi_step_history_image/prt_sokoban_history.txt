This is an image of a level of the Sokoban game.
Your task is to complete this level by outputting movement instructions based on this image one step at a time.

Objective: Move all boxes onto the docks (goals).

Rules:
    1. Movement: The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R).
    2. Pushing Boxes: The player can push one box at a time by moving towards it. Boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.
    3. Grid Limitations: The player and boxes can only move into empty spaces. Walls and other boxes block movement.

Restrictions:

    b. The player cannot move through boxes or walls.

Illustration:
	1. dashed grid: dock
	2. yellow box: box on the dock (can also be pushed)
	3. brown box: box on the floor

Instructions:
    1. Provide movement instructions using only the 4 letters: "L" (left), "R" (right), "U" (up), "D" (down).
    2. Use JSON as your output format: {"output": "L"} or {"output": "R"} or {"output": "U"} or  {"output": "D"}.
    3. If you think you are in an irreversible error state and want to return to the state at a certain step in history, use："{“output”: {number}}", {number} is the step number.
