Your task is to generate coordinates one at a time to complete the n_queens problem on a board where the first queen is already placed.

    2. The coordinate range is from 0 to 7.
    3. The position of the first queen is already given, so do not include it in your answer.
    4. Output the coordinates of each queen one at a time in the JSON format: {"output": [row, col]}
    5. If you think you are in an irreversible error state and want to return to the state at a certain step in history, use："{“output”: {number}}", {number} is the step number.
