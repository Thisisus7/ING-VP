This is an image of a level of the n_queens game.
Your task is to generate a list of coordinates to complete the n_queens problem on a board where the 
first queen is already placed.

Follow these rules:
Each queen must be placed in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.
	1. No two queens can share the same row.
	2. No two queens can share the same column.
	3. No two queens can share the same diagonal.

Note:
    1. An 8 x 8 chessboard with 8 queens.
	2. The coordinate range is from 0 to 7.
    2. The position of the first queen (red color) is already given, so do not include it in your answer.
    3. Your output should be in the JSON format: {"output": [[row_x1, col_y1], [row_x2, col_y2], ...]}. Each [row_x, col_y] means the coordinate you want to place your piece.
    4. If your chess piece violates the three rules, it will be ignored.

Your answer:
