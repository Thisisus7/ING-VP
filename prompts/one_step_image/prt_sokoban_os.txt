This is an image of a level of the Sokoban game.
Your task is to complete this level by outputting movement instructions based on this image.

Objective: Move all boxes onto the docks (goals).

Rules:
	1. Movement: The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R).
	2. Pushing Boxes: The player can push one box at a time by moving towards it. Boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.
	3. Grid Limitations: The player and boxes can only move into empty spaces. Walls and other boxes block movement.

Restrictions:
	a. A box cannot be pushed if there is another box or a wall directly behind it.
	b. The player cannot move through boxes or walls.

Illustration:
	1. dashed grid: dock
	2. yellow box: box on the dock (can also be pushed)
	3. brown box: box on the floor

Instructions:
	1. Provide movement instructions using only the 4 letters: "L" (left), "R" (right), "U" (up), "D" (down).
	2. For example, if you want to move two cells down, three cells to the right, one cell up, and two cells to the left, the example output: {"output": "DDRRRULL"}
