This is a text matrix of a level of the Sokoban game.
Your task is to complete this level by outputting movement instructions based on this text matrix.

Text matrix:

{text_representation_path}

Objective: Move all boxes onto the docks (goals).

Rules:
    1. Movement: The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R).
    2. Pushing Boxes: The player can push one box at a time by moving towards it. Boxes can only be pushed, not pulled.
    3. Grid Limitations: The player and boxes can only move into empty spaces. Walls and other boxes block movement.

Restrictions:
    a. A box cannot be pushed if there is another box or a wall directly behind it.
    b. The player cannot move through boxes or walls.

Illustration:
	1. '.': dock
    2. '$': box
	3. '*': box on the dock (can also be pushed)
    4. '@': worker (or agent)
    5. '+': worker on the dock
    6. ' ': floor
    7. '#': wall

Instructions:
	1. Provide movement instructions using only the 4 letters: "L" (left), "R" (right), "U" (up), "D" (down).
	2. For example, if you want to move two cells down, three cells to the right, one cell up, and two cells to the left, the example output: {"output": "DDRRRULL"}
